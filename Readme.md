# Crossplane

Crossplane is an open-source Kubernetes add-on that enables cloud infrastructure management using Kubernetes-native APIs. By extending the Kubernetes control plane, Crossplane allows you to define, compose, and manage infrastructure resources from multiple cloud providers using Kubernetes manifests.
This means you can leverage Kubernetes declarative, GitOps-friendly approach to manage not only your applications but also the underlying infrastructure they run on.
