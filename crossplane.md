# Crossplane Overview

This documentation provides an overview of crossplane

## Prerequisites

We need to ensure we have the following:

- A Kubernetes cluster with at least 2 GB of RAM.

- Permissions to create pods and secrets in the Kubernetes cluster.

- Helm version v3.2.0 or later.

- AWS CLI installed and configured.

### Configure AWS CLI

Run the following command to configure your AWS CLI:

```bash

aws  configure

```

### Update kubeconfig to Access the Cluster

Use the following command to update your kubeconfig and access the Kubernetes cluster:

```bash

aws  eks  --region  eu-west-3  update-kubeconfig  --name  ft-eks

```

## Overview

Crossplane integrates your Kubernetes cluster with external, non-Kubernetes resources, allowing platform teams to create custom Kubernetes APIs to manage these resources seamlessly. It provides a unified way to deploy, monitor, and manage cloud services such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud directly through Kubernetes.

## Key Components

### 1. Providers

- **Functionality:** Providers define how Crossplane connects to external services, each with its own set of CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions).

- **Applicability:** Available cluster-wide, enabling connections to any service with an API.

- **Use Case:** Essential for integrating services like AWS into your Kubernetes environment.

### 2. Provider Configurations

- **Functionality:** Configure authentication and global settings specific to each Provider.

- **Significance:** Ensures secure and consistent connections to external services.

### 3. Managed Resources

- **Functionality:** Represent individual external resources as Kubernetes objects.

- **Example:** Resources like S3 buckets, Lambda functions, API Gateway endpoints, and DynamoDB tables.

- **Benefit:** Allows management of cloud resources using Kubernetes-native tools (e.g., `kubectl`).

### 4. Compositions

- **Functionality:** Serve as templates that define a collection of Managed Resources.

- **Purpose:** Simplify resource management and allow platform teams to create standardized setups.

- **Customization:** Users can adjust settings within predefined boundaries.

### 5. Composite Resources (XR)

- **Functionality:** Implement the templates defined by Compositions, representing a set of provisioned Managed Resources.

- **Example:** A complete application setup combining S3, Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB.

- **Advantage:** Simplifies the deployment of complex, multi-resource configurations.

### 6. Composite Resource Definitions (XRDs)

- **Functionality:** Define custom Kubernetes APIs for managing Composite Resources and Claims.

- **Scope:** Cluster-wide impact, enabling the creation of custom resource types and claims.

- **Flexibility:** Allows the creation of tailored APIs for different infrastructure needs.

### 7. Claims

- **Functionality:** Provide developers with a namespace-scoped interface to request and manage resources.

- **Importance:** Supports multi-tenancy by isolating resource management within namespaces.

- **Benefit:** Empowers teams to independently manage resources without requiring cluster-wide permissions.

## Workflow Summary

1.  **Install Crossplane** in your Kubernetes cluster.

2.  **Set up Providers** (e.g., AWS Provider) to connect your cluster to external cloud services.

3.  **Create Managed Resources** (e.g., S3, Lambda) using Crossplane CRDs, representing external resources as Kubernetes objects.

Verify Access to the Cluster:

```bash

kubectl  get  nodes

```
